*Efficient, pure, no-exception binary serialisation using lazy ByteStrings.*

The ``restore`` package provides Data.Restore, containing the Restore class, and
associated methods, for serialising values to and from lazy ByteStrings.
A key feature of ``restore`` is that the interface is both pure, and efficient.

``restore`` is a fork of the ``binary`` package which included as part of The
Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).
``restore`` presents a similar API, but with a simplified implementation and (!)
a different binary serialisation format.

## Installing restore from Hackage ##

You can use ``cabal-install`` to install the most recent stable version
available from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/restore).

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install restore

## Building restore ##

``restore`` comes with both a test suite and a set of benchmarks.
While developing, you probably want to enable both.
Here's how to get the latest version of the repository, configure and build.

    $ git clone git@github.com:maaku/restore.git
    $ cd restore
    $ stack build

Run the test suite.

    $ stack test

To run the benchmark suite (optional):

    $ stack bench

## Using restore ##

First:

    import Data.Restore

and then write an instance of Restore for the type you wish to serialise.
An example doing exactly this can be found in the Data.Restore module.
You can also use the Data.Restore.Builder module to efficiently build
lazy bytestrings using the ``Builder`` monoid. Or, alternatively, the
Data.Restore.Get and Data.Restore.Put to serialize/deserialize using
the ``Get`` and ``Put`` monads.

More information can be found in the haddock documentation.

## Deriving restore instances using GHC's Generic ##

Beginning with GHC 7.2, it is possible to use binary serialization without
writing any instance boilerplate code.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import Data.Restore
import GHC.Generics (Generic)

data Foo = Foo deriving (Generic)

-- GHC will automatically fill out the instance
instance Restore Foo
```
